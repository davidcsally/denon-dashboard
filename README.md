# Denon-Dashboard

Denon-Dashboard is a web interface for controlling and sending commands to a Denon home theater receiver, using the separate Restful-Denon api.

# Features

- Turn your receiver on and off 
- Change the volume
- Mute / Unmute
- (coming soon...) input selection
- (coming soon...) zone 2 support
- (coming soon...) your features -> request and I will add them

## Getting Started

Ensure the restful-denon server is running and connected to your receiver.

// TODO explain more

## Contributing

I welcome any and all pull requests, suggestions, and bug reports. This is still a work in progress, so please be patient if you find a bug :)

## Why?

I don't like the official Denon app, so I am rebuilding it in a React interface (and future react native mobile client) using material ui

Tested on a Denon AVR1613.
